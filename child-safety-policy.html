    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>We are committed to maintaining a safe environment on our platform. This policy outlines our standards for
        preventing child sexual abuse and exploitation (CSAE) and protecting minors from any form of harm.</p>

    <h2>2. Prohibited Content</h2>
    <p>We strictly prohibit any of the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Images, videos, or text depicting or suggesting CSAE</li>
        <li>Grooming or predatory behavior targeting minors</li>
        <li>Any content that sexually exploits minors</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Age Screening and User Verification</h2>
    <p>We implement age screening mechanisms to restrict access to minors and help prevent misuse of the platform.</p>

    <h2>4. Content Moderation</h2>
    <p>Our team uses a combination of AI tools and human moderation to detect and remove harmful content, including
        potential CSAE-related content.</p>

    <h2>5. Reporting Mechanism</h2>
    <p>Users can report suspicious or harmful content directly through our app interface or by contacting us via email.
        All reports are reviewed within 24â€“48 hours.</p>

    <h2>6. Cooperation with Authorities</h2>
    <p>We work with law enforcement and child protection agencies and report confirmed CSAE incidents in compliance with
        legal requirements.</p>

    <h2>7. Data Protection</h2>
    <p>We protect user data in compliance with applicable laws such as GDPR. Logs and metadata associated with CSAE
        investigations may be shared with authorities when required.</p>
